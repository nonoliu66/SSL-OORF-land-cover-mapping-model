This repository contains the core code for automated large-scale land cover classification under the SSL-OORF framework. The workflow begins with Cluster-assisted Automated Sample Extraction, where unsupervised clustering is used to automatically extract high-purity initial training samples. Next, Multi-source Classification Feature Acquisition constructs comprehensive classification features by integrating spectral information, vegetation indices, texture measures, and topographic variables. Then, Sample Transfer Analysis evaluates the transferability of training samples across different years using spectral similarity metrics such as spectral angle distance and Euclidean distance. Based on the transfer analysis, Sample Screening and Feature Importance Analysis further filters low-consistency samples and analyzes feature importance to improve training sample reliability. Subsequently, Optimization of Object-based Segmentation Scale determines the optimal segmentation scale for object-based image analysis, ensuring that image objects match land cover spatial patterns. After segmentation optimization, Feature Extraction of Unlabeled Samples extracts object-level features for unlabeled samples to support semi-supervised learning. Finally, SSL-OORF Model for Reference Year trains the semi-supervised optimized object-based random forest model using high-confidence labeled samples, and SSL-OORF Model for Target Years applies the trained model to target years to produce consistent multi-year land cover classification results.
